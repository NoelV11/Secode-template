Examining Vulnerable_14.c

FINAL RESULTS:

Vulnerable_14.c:54:  [3] (buffer) getenv:
  Environment variables are untrustable input if they can be set by an
  attacker. They can have any content and length, and the same variable can
  be set more than once (CWE-807, CWE-20). Check environment variables
  carefully before using them.
